# Calculator

Calculator created with Javascript, HTML, and CSS

Used DOM manipulation methods to update the display, gather button click information such as the ID of the button being pressed, and
implementing keyboard functionality

Used CSS for general design of a basic calculator, using CSS grid and flexbox

Used HTML for basic webpage layout
    - tried to use descriptive element names instead of creating a bunch of divs

Overall, this project was challenging and exercised my ability to think logically using the thought process of a software developer.
I ran into issues that I could solve without help/referencing material, but the way I was approaching the problem was wrong. Once I redeveloped my thought process on how to tackle each problem individually, the actual coding portion was much easier. Overall this project emphasized the need for psuedo-code and how important it is to put pen to paper instead of trying to code immediately.

---- May refactor code later ------
